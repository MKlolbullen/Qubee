# Qubee  <!-- Logo/branding here later -->
> **Post-quantum, peer-to-peer messaging, audio/video calls & file-sharing BUT NO servers, NO back-end and (hopefully...) no excuses.**

## Why Qubee?
Current “secure” messengers still hinge on **centralised infrastructure** or **pre-quantum key exchange**.  
Qubee flips the table:

* **100 % peer-to-peer**—metadata never touches a server.  
* **Hybrid Kyber-768 + Dilithium-2 Double Ratchet**—post-quantum confidentiality _and_ authentication.  
* **Rust first**—memory-safety without a garbage collector.

> **Reality check:** Qubee is *research-grade*. Expect sharp edges and zero backwards-compat guarantees.

## Features
| Category | Qubee |
|----------|-------|
| Post-quantum | Kyber-768 KEM + Dilithium-2 sigs inside a classical Double Ratchet. |
| Sealed Sender | Ephemeral Dilithium sig per packet—sender unlinkability. |
| Cover Traffic | Configurable dummy packets for audio, text & files. |
| File integrity | BLAKE3 chunk hashing; pass/fail before file release. |
| Trust model | TOFU _or_ pre-pinned keys; change alerts. |
| Zero servers | NAT traversal via UDP hole-punching; no fallback relay. |
| Extensible | Pluggable ZK-proof layer (SNARKs/Bulletproofs stubs). |
